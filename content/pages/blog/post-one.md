7 Steps to starting a C-SCRM program

*   Apply C-SCRM at each governance layer (Enterprise, Organization, System) by having plans

*   Figure out what is critical and what is disposable (and what connects to what) 

*   Evaluate what you are buying and keep track of it after it is bought

*   Consider the threats and tradeoffs

*   Have a path to communicate throughout the organization (from the top to bottom // bottom to top )

*   Implement counter-measures 

*   Share information
